## overview  {background-color='#ffcccc' background-opacity='40%'}

:::{.incremental}
  - students will be in groups of about five to collectively do a data analysis project.
  - choose a public health related dataset that has quite a few columns and observations. 
  - students should think about if there are datasets they can merge together to create more interesting observations.

## organization  {background-color='#86C0FF' background-opacity='40%'}

<div style='font-size: 22px;'>
:::{.incremental}
  - Work together to submit a GitHub repository that
contains a reproducible document created in R Markdown or Quarto including its
code. 
  - Both the R Markdown / Quarto document and the GitHub repository itself
should be well organized and documented.
  - In the reproducible document produced, we are looking to see the following: 
    - An introduction to the topic and motivation
    - Text describing the analysis/programming
    - Conclusions
    - At least one (nice) table 
    - Either one very nice, polished infographic style figure, or a few informative, well-labeled and interesting figures about what you found in investigating the data.
    - Please include an author contributions statement at the end.

Does the project demonstrate the reproducible workflow principles taught in the class? This includes: 

<ul>
<li>Clearly commented code </li> 
<li> A well-organized GitHub repository </li> 
<li> The creation of informative, well-labeled visualizations and at least one table </li> </ul> </th> 

<th> 75% </th> </tr>

The repository should include reflections about what students learned in the process of completing the final project. These reflections should note

<ol>
<li>what students figured out how to do along-the-way</li>
<li>what they struggled with</li>
<li>what they wouldn’t have been able to do before taking this class, and 
<li>what principles they found useful in decision-making during the project.</li>
