Hi!  I'm Christian Testa üëã  I'm now a 1st year PhD student in 
Biostatistics and I've been a statistical analyst working at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for a little over 6 years.

My recent research has focused on addressing health disparities and
inequities in the US.  

The projects I've worked on recently have focused on epigenetic
aging, multiple types of discrimination, COVID-19, and spatiotemporal
methods in epidemiology. <br><br>

Hi there! I‚Äôm Dean Marengi, a current PhD student in the Department of Environmental Health. I received my MPH in epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and have been involved in public health research for over ten years. Broadly, I am interested in studying the relationship between prenatal environmental exposures and the subsequent development of neuropsychiatric outcomes. <br><br>

I‚Äôm a self-taught R programmer who is very enthusiastic about data cleaning, and even more enthusiastic about helping others learn how to clean their data!

Hi, I‚Äôm Jarvis Chen, a Lecturer in Social and Behavioral Sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Associate Director of the PhD Program in Population Health Sciences at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. I teach multiple courses in quantitative research methods and I‚Äôm passionate about causal inference, methods development, and population health science pedagogy.<br><br>

I've been a self-taught programmer for >25 years ü´† and I love learning from other people about the different ways we can analyze and understand data.

## our goals 

<br>
our goal is to give you the roadmap, time, and space you need to grow your R
skills. <br><br>

all our lecture recordings and slides will be online so you can refer back to
them as you need to.

## some pep talk {background-color='#f7d794' background-opacity='40%'}

:::{.smaller}
It‚Äôs easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm really stupid,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not made out to program.‚Äù But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It‚Äôs just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don‚Äôt blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. <br><br>

## course overview 

before we dive in, we want to make sure you have a few things in hand: 

  * our course website: <br>
    <span class='tab'></span>{{< fa solid earth-americas >}} <https://id529.github.io/>
  * our syllabus: <br>
    <span class='tab'></span>{{< fa graduation-cap >}} <https://id529.github.io/syllabus/>

## key objectives 

:::{.incremental .smaller}
  *	students will learn <span class='carrot'>**best practices**</span> for data cleaning, management, and project organization in the context of R programming based analyses focused on Population Health Science.
  *	<span class='carrot'>**reproducibility**</span> will be emphasized to teach students both the merits of reproducible workflows as well as how to build and implement them.
  *	learning git and github to <span class='carrot'>**version control**<span> and <span class='carrot'>**disseminate**</span> code.
:::

## key objectives (continued) 

:::{.incremental .smaller}
  *	<span class='carrot'>**exploratory data analysis**</span> skills including:
    * <span class='carrot'>**data visualization**</span>
    * working with <span class='carrot'>**regression models**</span>
    * creating <span class='carrot'>**professional reports**</span>
  *	how to leverage online resources to <span class='carrot'>**get help**</span> with any R programming challenges.

## tracks for the course  {background-color='#ffcccc' background-opacity='40%'}

<div style='font-size: 32px;'>

keeping in mind that it's impossible to learn _all_ of R in any short period of
time, we want to encourage you to be thoughtful about how you can get the 
most out of this course.

We think every data analyst needs to know something about each of: 

::: {.incremental}
  - Programming
  - Data Visualization
  - Data Cleaning + Management and Working with Codebooks
  - and Reproducibility
:::

## homeworks

:::{.smaller}
:::{.fragment}
there is a small homework due tonight, another homework due Sunday night, a first-draft of the final 
project, and the final project.  <br><br>
:::

:::{.fragment}
additionally, we are asking you to do peer reviews on the homework so that:
:::

:::{.incremental}
  1. you benefit from learning how others approached the same problem, and 
  2. you practice articulating constructive feedback related to programming in R.
:::
:::

## rubric for homework {.small}

:::{.fragment}
your homework will be evaluated on the following rubric:
:::

:::{.fragment}
+---+---+
| objective/principle                                     | percent of grade | 
| -----                                                   | -:              |
| does it accomplish the stated goal? is it complete?     | 25%             |
| is it well documented and commented?                    | 25%             |
| is it transparent and clearly motivated? is it elegant, i.e., not kludgey? | 25% | 
| does it incorporate what's been taught? does it reflect growth? | 25% | 
+---+---+
:::

:::{.fragment}
we really just want to see that you're <span class='carrot'>**learning**</span>, <span class='carrot'>**growing as a programmer**</span>, and
using the homeworks to <span class='carrot'>**challenge yourself in a healthy, productive way**</span>.

## class discussions {.smaller}

:::{.fragment}
throughout the class, we'll be having several discussion
based activities in various formats. <br><br>
:::

:::{.fragment}
we want to make sure everyone has a chance to shine, 
so please make sure that you 1) aren't dominating the discussions and 2) please be aware that your questions are
completely welcome in our discussions. <br><br>

## slack & communication 

we'll be active on the <span class='carrot'>Slack</span> that is linked to 
through Canvas -- we'd love to see you on there,
to answer questions for you, and to see you collaborate
together.

if you have questions that you'd like to ask the instructional team in private, <span class='carrot'>
please email *all three of us*</span> and we'll reply-all to you so the whole
instructional team knows if your question has been answered by another one of
us.

## recordings 

we'll be recording the lectures (but not discussions) and posting them online so
you can refer back to them during the course and after.
